prot-T5:

prediction of subcellular localization and the differentiation between membrane-bound and water-soluble proteins, simultaneously

essential biophysical amino acid features, including charge, polarity, size, hydrophobicity, even to the level of aliphatic ([AILMV]) vs. aromatic ([WFY])


to some extent, between proteins according to their secondary structure composition

protein function as proxied by enzymatic activity and subcellular localization
